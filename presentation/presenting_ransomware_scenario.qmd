### Citum Energy Solutions
Citum Energy has grown from 0 to 200 employees and $50M in 10 years. The company does clean energy solutions and consulting with several enterprise customers and government arms. They hold some consumer PII, but are primarily focused on larger customers.  Employees are a dispersed remote or hybrid workforce, primarily in Denmark but with outsourced development in India.  The company has grown fast and data security matters but it has been more difficult to control as people and process become more difficult to track in this fast-moving environment.

- Elevated to Global Admin via password vault access
- Attackers created multiple new admin accounts and reset passwords of existing admin accounts
- While attackers contacted the CEO, endpoint ransomware was being prepared
  - Attempts to remove the attackers from the environment were incomplete

- Ransomware deployed to endpoints in a further attempt to get payment

## Which actions should be taken? {.smaller}
- Engage Incident Response Plan
- Investigate suspicious login and subsequent activity
- Identify status of backups
- Identify gaps in current configuration
- Hire incident response firm
- Examination of endpoint logs for unusual connections
- Use multiple tools to form a larger picture
  - MS Sentinel partially deployed and of use, but log storage is limited due to lack of budget
- Forensics on Azure/M365 and affected workstations
- Engage legal counsel/DPO as data was stolen
  - Must assume breach
- Use of communication plan
- Completely remove attacker!
